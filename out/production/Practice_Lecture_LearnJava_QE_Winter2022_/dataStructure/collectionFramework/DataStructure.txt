#Collection in java is a framework that provide an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.

#
Java collection means a single unit of objects.
java collection framework provides many interfaces
-Interface are:
-Set
-List
-Queue
-Deque

Classes are:
-ArrayList
-Vector
-LinkedList
-PriorityQueue
-HashSet
-LinkedHashSet
-TreeSet




Arrays:

- An array is a data structure that allows you to store multiple values of the
same type into a single variable

- The default values of numeric array elements are set to zero.

- Arrays are zero indexed; an array with n elements is indexed from 0 to n-1,
for example; 10 elements index range is from 0 to 9.

- If we try to access index that is out of range, Java will give us
an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, which indicates that the index is out of range,
in other words its out of bounds.

- To access array elements we use square braces [ and ], also known as
array access operator.




Example of creating a new array:

    int [] array = new int[5];

- This array contains the elements from array[0] to array[4]
- It has 5 elements and the index range is 0 to 4.
- The new operator or keyword is used to create the array and initialize the
array elements to their default values.
- In this example, all the array elements are initialized to zero since this
is an int array.
- For boolean, array elements would be initialized to false.
- For String or other objects, it would be null.

    int[] myNumbers = {6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0};

- We can also initialize an array inline by using array initializer block { and }.
Values we defined need to be separated by a comma.
- This way of initializing an array is also known as an anonymous array.
- It has 7 elements and index range 0 to 6.
- In this example, array elements are initialized to 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and 0.


So let's say we create an array of size 5.

    int[] myArray = new int[5];

- Each element at index 0 through 4 would be set to 0.

    myArray[5] = 55; // out of bounds

- Accessing index out of range will cause error in other words,
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
- We have 5 elements and index range is 0 to 4.

- When looping through an array, be sure to have the index start at 0,
since datastructure.arrays are zero indexed. Do not make the mistake of starting from
index 1. Also be cautious of the termination.


# 2D Array/ Multidimensional Array: simple words as array of arrays

Data in 2D Array are stored in tabular form (in row major order)

Syntax: dataType[1st Dimension][2nd Dimension] =new dataType[size1][size2]

ARRAYLIST
The java ArrayList implements List Interface
ArrayList always maintain insertion order of the elements
ArrayList only stores value or element
ArrayList can contain duplicate elements
We can have any numbers of null elements in ArrayList
ArrayList get() method always gives an O(1) performance

ArrayList Vs Linked List
>>Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses an array. If any element is removed from the array, all the bits are shifted in memory.
>>Manipulation with LinkedList is faster than ArrayList because it uses a doubly linked list, so no bit shifting is required in memory.

>> An ArrayList class can act as a list only because it implements List only.
>> LinkedList class can act as a list and queue both because it implements List and Deque interfaces.

>> ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data.
>> LinkedList is better for manipulating data.



#Map:
Few characteristics of the Map Interface are:

A Map cannot contain duplicate keys and each key can map to at most one value.
Some implementations allow null key and null value like the HashMap and LinkedHashMap,
but some do not like the TreeMap.
The order of a map depends on specific implementations,
e.g TreeMap and LinkedHashMap have predictable order, while HashMap does not.
There are two interfaces for implementing Map in java: Map and SortedMap,
and three classes: HashMap, TreeMap and LinkedHashMap.



HASHMAP
The java HashMap is implements Map interface
HashMap does not maintain the insertion order
HashMap stores key and value pairs
HashMap does not contain duplicate keys but contain duplicate values.
We can have only one null key and any number of null values in HashMap
HashMap get()method can be O(1) in the best case and O(n) in the worst case

#Wrapper Classes in Java
A Wrapper class is a class whose object wraps or contains a primitive data types.
When we create an object to a wrapper class, it contains a field and in this field, we can store a primitive data types.
In other words, we can wrap a primitive value into a wrapper class object.

Need of Wrapper Classes

They convert primitive data types into objects. Objects are needed if we wish to modify the arguments passed into a method (because primitive types are passed by value).
The classes in java.util package handles only objects and hence wrapper classes help in this case also.
Data structures in the Collection framework, such as ArrayList and Vector, store only objects (reference types) and not primitive types.
An object is needed to support synchronization in multithreading.


==================================================================================

1. Collection Interface :
The root interface in the collection hierarchy. A collection represents a group of objects, known as its elements.
The JDK does not provide any direct implementations of this interface: The implementation splitted to its child interfaces and their implementation classes.
Collection interface provides the most common general methods which are applicable for any collection object (List, Set, Queue implementations).
2. List Interface :
An ordered collection (also known as a sequence).
Insertion order preserved, if user used List type implementation, user has control over the order, because the insertion order and retrieval order of an element is same.
If List type implementations used Duplicate elements allowed to insert.
3. Set Interface :
Insertion order not preserved, if user used Set type implementation, user has no control over the order, because the insertion order and retrieval order of an element is not same.
If Set type implementations used Duplicate elements not allowed to insert.
4. SortedSet Interface :
Child interface of Set. It is a set that holds the elements in natural sorting (Ascending) order.
The element which we are adding to a SortedSet implementation that element should implements Comparable Interface. Because when we are adding element, it uses Comparable implementation to sort the order. ( Just remember this Interface Comparable, I will explain more in depth details about Comparator and sorting order in further tutorials).
5. NavigableSet Interface :
It is a set that extends SortedSet, it means it is child Interface of SortedSet.
It provides navigational methods. For example if you want to retrieve an element that higher than or less than a given value. If you want such kind of navigation, NavigableSet provides navigational utility methods.
6. Queue Interface :
A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing.
A queue supports the insert and remove operations using a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) manner.
Queue provides prior to processing methods.
7. Map Interface :
An object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys; each key can map to at most one value.
Map represent each element as key value pair, and that key value pair called Entry.
Map interface provides the most common methods that is applicable for any Map implementation type object.
8. SortedMap Interface :
Child interface of Map. It is a map that holds the key elements in natural sorting (Ascending) order.
The key element which we are adding to a SortedMap implementation that element should implements Comparable Interface. Because when we are adding element, it uses Comparable implementation to sort the order. ( Just remember this Interface Comparable, I will explain more in depth details about Comparator and sorting order in further tutorials).
9. NavigableMap Interface :
It is a Map that extends SortedMap, it means it is child Interface of SortedMap.
It provides navigational methods. For example if you want to retrieve a key element that higher than or less than a given key. If you want such kind of navigation, NavigableMap provides navigational utility methods.
