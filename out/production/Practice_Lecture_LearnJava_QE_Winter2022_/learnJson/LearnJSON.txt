JSON is an open standard file format, and data interchange format,
that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and array data types.
It is a very common data format, with a diverse range of applications,
such as serving as a replacement for XML in AJAX systems.


JSON: JavaScript Object Notation.

JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.

JSON is text, written with JavaScript object notation.


Why use JSON?
Since the JSON format is text only, it can easily be sent to and from a server, and used as a data format by any programming language.
JavaScript has a built in function to convert a string, written in JSON format, into native JavaScript objects:
JSON.parse()
So, if you receive data from a server, in JSON format, you can use it like any other JavaScript object.

#curly braces start and close indicate it's an object. i,e, {  } object

Properties name : value

KEY : Value
name: juniad
name = "James"

Why JSON is Better Than XML
XML is much more difficult to parse than JSON.
JSON is parsed into a ready-to-use JavaScript object.

For AJAX applications, JSON is faster and easier than XML:

Using XML

Fetch an XML document
Use the XML DOM to loop through the document
Extract values and store in variables

Using JSON
Fetch a JSON string
JSON.Parse the JSON string
